## Why use Racecar?

- Racecar is a lightweight Python library for sampling distributions in high dimensions using cutting-edge algorithms. It can also be used for rapid prototyping of novel methods and application to large problems.
- Pass a function evaluating the log posterior and/or its gradient, and away you go. Ideal for usage with big data applications, neural networks, regression, mixture modelling, and all sorts of Bayesian inference and sampling problems.
- Easily to use and simple to extend with new methods and use cases.
- Designed for use with stochastic gradients in mind.

## Examples

##### Quickstart example

We will sample points from the one-dimensional distribution <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\pi(x)\propto%20\exp(-x^2/12-\cos(2x))" /> using the random walk Metropolis algorithm, and then plot the results.

```python
# Import racecar and numpy
import racecar as rc
import numpy as np

# Define the target log posterior function
# Note we only need it up to a constant multiple, so we do not need to
# know its normalization constant.
def log_posterior(x):
  return {
  'llh' : -( np.cos(2*x) + x**2/12 )
  }

# Create the sampler object and use Random Walk Metropolis
initial_condition = [0]
learning_rate = 0.5
S = rc.sampler(initial_condition, learning_rate, log_posterior, algo="RWMetropolis")

# Sample some points, outputting arrays of the position and the log posterior
number_of_points = 100000
Pos_traj, LLH_traj = S.sample(number_of_points, output=['pos','llh'])

# Plot the results using matplotlib
```

## Installation

You can install the package from source by cloning this repo and using `setup.py`, the only dependencies are on `numpy` and `scipy`. Otherwise it is available on pip via

    pip install racecar
